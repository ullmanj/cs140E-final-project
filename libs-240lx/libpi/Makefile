# simple definitions for making libpi.a
#  - you should only ever have to modify SRC or STAFF_OBJS

# copy any file you want to add to libpi.a to the libpi/src
# directory.  and then add it to this variable.  
#
# for example if you want to add your gpio.c, 
#   1. copy gpio.c to src/gpio.c
#   2. define SRC as:
#           SRC := ./src/gpio.c
#
# tip: if you want to automatically add all .S and .c files 
# in src/ do:
#   SRC := $(wildcard ./src/*.[Sc])
#
# currently not defined to hold anything
SRC :=

# if you want to use our gpio.o or other .o (e.g., if yours
# is acting weird):
#   1. remove the file from SRC and 
#   2. add it to STAFF_OBJS 
#
#
# currently: use our uart.o (for printk) and gpio.o
